My name is Jackson and I'm a data analyst, software developer and environmentalist.

I was born in Toronto, Canada, and I studied Physics at McGill University until 2017. I focused my bachelor thesis on using Machine Learning to study exoplanets, and learnt a bit of python along the way. As it became more obvious that not enough was being done to curb climate change, I decided to leverage what I knew to help as much as I could.

I now focus most of my effort into developing tools and research to help align financial institutions and policy-makers with climate goals, using clear, scientifically sound metrics. I work for a non-profit think tank in Berlin called [2 Degrees Investing Inititaitve](https://2degrees-investing.org/) that exists in the burgeoning field of climate finance. I also like learning about and advocating for new ways to make the world more sustainble, both at the institutional, and invididual level.

I'm always keen to help with interesting projects, so feel free to reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jdhoffart).
