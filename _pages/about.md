Hi im jackson, this is my blog

I'm a canadian, software developer, analyst, living in Berlin, DE

I studied astrophysics at mcgill university, picking up data analysis and machine learning tools along the way

I shifted my focus to the climate crisis, and want to use my knowledge and skillset to build tools and knowledge that can address this global emergency
