Welcome to my first post on here!

I'm starting this blog in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, since I, as many of us, have way too much time on my hands. I don't have a fully planned vision for what I'll be posting on here yet, but suffice to say the majority of the posts will be related to climate change. That said, this issue intersects such a diverse range of topics - social inequality, poverty, racism, sexism - it's difficult to leave anything off the table. For now, all opinions will be my own, but in the near future I'd like to be able to offer this blog as a platform to amplify a more diverse variety of voices.

Beyond all of that, I will also discuss my own personal endeavours in software, and highlighting some of the tools and projects I think are inspiring.

That's it for now, more posts to come soon!
