Hello! My name is Jackson and I'm a data analyst and software developer. I develop tools, metrics and research that aim to help mitigate anthropogenic climate change.

I'm a Canadian who was born and raised in Toronto. I studied Physics at McGill University (in Montreal) for 5 years, where I received my BSc., in 2017. During my studies, I waffled around for a while between different branches of physics and dedicated most of my summers to research projects. Machine learning got pretty trendy while I was in my undergrad, so I aimed my bachelor thesis at co-writing a python-implementation of a gaussian process regression model to study exoplanets (if you're interested in any of this kind of stuff, check out Dan Foreman-Mackey's [work](https://dfm.io/), he's rad).

While I was studying physics, it always felt a little like the world was burning in the background. My parents live in the woods out in British Columbia, and one summer the world around them was, literally, burning. Forest fires in the west coast of Canada have gotten more frequent, bigger and more destructive as a direct result of climate change and that hit was a little too close to home for me. I decided to leverage my knowledge in data analysis and software development to help fight the good fight.

This more or less brings us to now.  I work for a non-profit think tank in Berlin called [2 Degrees Investing Inititaitve](https://2degrees-investing.org/). We exist in the burgeoning field of climate finance, and are working to align the financial sector to climate goals. My work in particular focuses on the development and improvement of the Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment [PACTA](https://www.transitionmonitor.com/).

I'm always keen to help with interesting projects, so feel free to reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jdhoffart).

If you're looking for an open-source climate-oriented project to help contribute to, check out [Project Drawdown Solutions](https://github.com/ProjectDrawdown/solutions). This is an in-progress Python-implementation of the [Project Drawdown](https://www.drawdown.org/) climate model engine.
