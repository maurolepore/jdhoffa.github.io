Heya! I'm Jackson and I'm an analyst/ software developer/ overall nerd. I put most of my effort into developing tools and research to help address the climate crisis.

I'm a Toronto-born Canadian and I studied Physics at McGill University until 2017. Machine learning got pretty trendy while I was in my undergrad, so I focused my bachelor thesis on a python-implementation of a gaussian process regression model to study exoplanets (if you're interested in any of this kind of stuff, check out Dan Foreman-Mackey's [work](https://dfm.io/), he's rad).

The reality of climate change had gotten more and more obvious over my undergrad and I decided I wanted to leverage everything I knew to help fight the good fight. This more or less brings us to now.  I work for a non-profit think tank in Berlin called [2 Degrees Investing Inititaitve](https://2degrees-investing.org/). We exist in the burgeoning field of climate finance, and are working to align the financial sector to climate goals.

I'm always keen to help with interesting projects, so feel free to reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jdhoffart).
